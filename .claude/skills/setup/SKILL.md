# Turbine Setup

You are helping a user set up their environment to trade on Turbine's prediction markets. This skill handles everything from cloning the repo to having a funded wallet — after this, the user is ready to create their first bot.

### Key URLs

Reference these throughout setup — both for your own lookups and to share with users:

- **Platform:** https://beta.turbinefi.com
- **Leaderboard:** https://beta.turbinefi.com/leaderboard
- **Docs (overview):** https://beta.turbinefi.com/docs
- **Fees & Gas:** https://beta.turbinefi.com/docs/fees-and-gas
- **Architecture:** https://beta.turbinefi.com/docs/architecture
- **Build a Trading Bot:** https://beta.turbinefi.com/docs/api/build-a-trading-bot
- **API Reference:** https://beta.turbinefi.com/docs/api
- **Authentication:** https://beta.turbinefi.com/docs/api/authentication
- **API Host:** https://api.turbinefi.com

If a user asks questions you can't answer from CLAUDE.md or the repo, fetch the relevant docs page above.

**What this skill does NOT do:**
- Generate any bot code (that's `/create-bot`)
- Explain trading algorithms or strategy design
- Deploy anything to the cloud (that's `/railway-deploy`)

## Step 0: Understand Who You're Helping

This may be the user's very first interaction with Claude in this repo. Before touching any code, figure out who they are. This shapes everything — how much you explain, what you skip, and what tone you use.

Turbine's users fall into a 2x2 matrix (see CLAUDE.md for full details):

|  | Low Technical | High Technical |
|--|---------------|----------------|
| **Knows PMs** | Understands trading, needs code help | Power user, can self-serve |
| **New to PMs** | Needs help with everything | Can code, needs PM concepts first |

Use `AskUserQuestion` with **two questions**:

1. **"How comfortable are you with Python and the command line?"**
   - Options: "Beginner — I'll need guidance" / "Comfortable — I've used Python before" / "Expert — just show me what to run"

2. **"How familiar are you with prediction markets?"**
   - Options: "Never heard of them" / "I get the concept but haven't traded" / "I've traded prediction markets before"

**Adapt your behavior based on the answers:**

- **Low tech + low PM:** Be thorough on everything. Explain what a virtual environment is, what a private key is, what USDC is. Don't assume any prior knowledge. This is the largest potential user group.
- **Low tech + high PM:** They understand the trading side — don't over-explain markets. Focus your patience on the technical steps (Python, wallet, .env).
- **High tech + low PM:** The code setup will be fast — they might not even need your help. But pause and make sure they understand what they're actually trading before moving on. Reference `docs/prediction-markets.md` or explain the core concepts from CLAUDE.md.
- **High tech + high PM:** Be concise. Skip explanations, just run the commands and move fast. They'll ask if they need something.

Carry this context through every subsequent step. A beginner needs "here's what a virtual environment is and why we use one." An expert needs "setting up venv" and nothing more.

### Save the user context

After the questions above, also ask:

3. **"What brings you to Turbine?"**
   - Options: "I'm in a hackathon right now" / "I want to compete in the weekly competition" / "Just exploring / learning" / "Building for a specific project"

**Create `user-context.md` in the repo root** using the Write tool. This file persists across sessions and skills so Claude doesn't have to re-ask these questions every time. It's gitignored (personal to this user).

```markdown
# User Context

## Profile
- **Technical level:** [beginner / comfortable / expert]
- **PM familiarity:** [none / conceptual / experienced]
- **Goal:** [hackathon / weekly competition / exploring / specific project]

## Setup Status
- **Date:** [today's date]
- **Chain:** [Base Sepolia / Polygon / Avalanche]
- **Wallet address:** [filled in after Step 3]

## Notes
[Any other context gathered during conversation — e.g., "interested in momentum strategies", "coming from Polymarket", "has 3 days for hackathon"]
```

Add `user-context.md` to `.gitignore` if it's not already there — this file is personal and should never be committed.

**Why this file matters:** Other skills (like `/create-bot`) will read `user-context.md` instead of re-asking the same questions. If a user runs `/create-bot` without having run `/setup`, Claude can still ask — but if the file exists, Claude already knows who it's helping.

---

## Step 0.5: Set the Stage

After profiling, **don't immediately jump into running commands.** Have a brief conversational moment first. The user just answered 3 questions — acknowledge them and set expectations for what's coming.

**For all users**, give a quick roadmap:

> "Great — here's the plan. There are a few things we need to get set up: a Python environment, a wallet (for signing trades), and a connection to Turbine's API. I'll check what's already done and handle the rest. Should take just a few minutes."

**Adapt the tone based on their profile:**

- **Low tech + low PM:** Add warmth and reassurance: "Don't worry if any of this sounds unfamiliar — I'll explain each step as we go. You don't need to know crypto or Python internals to get this working."
- **Low tech + high PM:** "You know the trading side — I'll handle the technical plumbing and explain what I'm doing along the way."
- **High tech + low PM:** "The setup itself is straightforward. Once we're done, I'll make sure you understand what you're actually trading before we build anything."
- **High tech + high PM:** Keep it short: "Let me check what's already set up." (They don't need a roadmap.)

**For users new to PMs**, this is also a good moment for a one-line hook about what they're building toward:

> "By the end of this, you'll have a bot that automatically trades Bitcoin prediction markets — betting on whether BTC goes up or down every 15 minutes."

Then move to the environment check.

---

## Step 1: Assess Current State

Check where the user already is. Run this as a **single command** (not separate calls — this avoids noisy parallel failures):

```bash
echo "=== Environment Check ===" && python3 --version 2>&1 && echo "VENV: ${VIRTUAL_ENV:-not_set}" && (python3 -c "import turbine_client; print('SDK: OK')" 2>/dev/null || echo "SDK: NOT_INSTALLED") && (test -f .env && grep -q "TURBINE_PRIVATE_KEY=0x" .env && echo "PRIVATE_KEY: SET" || echo "PRIVATE_KEY: NOT_SET") && (test -f .env && grep -q "TURBINE_API_KEY_ID=." .env && echo "API_CREDS: SET" || echo "API_CREDS: NOT_SET")
```

Based on results, skip any steps that are already complete. Summarize for the user in plain language — don't show them the raw output:

> "Here's where you stand: Python is ready, but you still need [X, Y, Z]. Let me take care of that."

If **everything** is already set up, say so and suggest `/create-bot`:

> "You're fully set up — Python environment, SDK, wallet credentials, everything looks good. Ready to build a bot? Run `/create-bot` to get started."

---

## Step 2: Python Environment

**Skip if:** Python 3.9+ is available AND a venv is active AND `turbine_client` imports successfully.

### If no virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
```

Explain briefly: *"A virtual environment keeps Turbine's dependencies separate from your system Python. This prevents version conflicts."*

> **For non-technical users:** This step can be confusing. Explain clearly:
> - "Think of a virtual environment like a separate workspace. It keeps this project's tools from interfering with anything else on your computer."
> - "The `source .venv/bin/activate` command activates this workspace. You'll need to run it every time you open a new terminal window before running your bot. If you see `(.venv)` at the start of your terminal prompt, you're in the right workspace."
> - Run the commands for them — don't ask them to type them.

### If SDK not installed:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This installs the Turbine SDK and all its dependencies from the repo's `pyproject.toml`. The install may take 30-60 seconds.

> **For non-technical users:** If they see a wall of text scrolling by during install, reassure them: "That's normal — it's downloading and installing the libraries the bot needs. Just wait for it to finish."

### Verify:

```bash
python3 -c "from turbine_client import TurbineClient; print('Turbine SDK ready')"
```

If this fails, troubleshoot:
- Wrong Python version? Need 3.9+
- Not in the repo root? `cd` to where `pyproject.toml` lives
- pip install failed? Check error output, likely a missing system dependency

---

## Step 3: Wallet & Private Key

**Skip if:** `.env` exists and contains `TURBINE_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...` (non-empty).

The user needs an Ethereum-compatible private key. This is what the bot uses to sign transactions — it never leaves their machine.

> **For users new to prediction markets / crypto:** This step is often the most confusing part of setup. They may not know what a wallet, private key, or Ethereum even is. Explain before asking:
> - "To trade on Turbine, your bot needs a **wallet** — think of it like a bank account number. It has two parts: a **public address** (like an account number — safe to share) and a **private key** (like a password — never share this with anyone)."
> - "Your bot uses the private key to sign its trades. This happens entirely on your computer — the key is never sent to Turbine or anywhere else."
> - "We'll generate one for you right now in Python — it takes one second. You don't need to download anything or create any accounts."
>
> For non-PM users, **strongly recommend Option A** (generate in Python). MetaMask adds steps that aren't necessary and will feel like a detour into crypto-land.

### Ask first:

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- **"Do you already have an Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask)?"**
- Options: "Yes, I have a private key ready" / "No, I need to create one"

### If they have a key:

Ask them to paste it. **Reassure them:**
> "Your private key stays local in the `.env` file — it's gitignored, so it won't be committed to version control. It's used to sign transactions (free, off-chain) and is never sent to any server."

### If they need to create one:

> **For non-PM users:** Skip the MetaMask option and go straight to Python generation. Present it as the default: "Let me generate a wallet for you." Don't make them choose between two options they don't have context to evaluate.

**Option A — Generate in Python (fastest, recommended for new users):**
```bash
python3 -c "from eth_account import Account; a = Account.create(); print(f'Address: {a.address}'); print(f'Private Key: {a.key.hex()}')"
```

Tell them to **save the address** (they'll need it for funding) and that you'll put the private key in `.env` for them.

**Option B — MetaMask (only offer if they ask, or for users who already know crypto):**
1. Install MetaMask browser extension from metamask.io
2. Create a new wallet (save the seed phrase somewhere safe)
3. Export private key: Click account icon → Settings → Security & Privacy → Export Private Key
4. Copy the key

### Create the .env file:

Once you have the private key, **create the file directly using the Write tool**. Don't tell the user to do it — do it for them:

```
TURBINE_PRIVATE_KEY=0x<their_key>
TURBINE_API_KEY_ID=
TURBINE_API_PRIVATE_KEY=
CHAIN_ID=84532
TURBINE_HOST=https://api.turbinefi.com
```

**Explain the fields briefly:**
- `TURBINE_PRIVATE_KEY` — Their wallet's signing key. Never leaves this machine.
- `TURBINE_API_KEY_ID` / `TURBINE_API_PRIVATE_KEY` — Left blank intentionally. The bot auto-registers API credentials on first run and saves them back to this file.
- `CHAIN_ID=84532` — Base Sepolia (testnet). Safe for learning. Switch to `137` (Polygon) for real trading later.
- `TURBINE_HOST` — Turbine's API endpoint.

---

## Step 4: Funding

**Skip if:** User says they already have USDC on their target chain.

The bot needs USDC (a stablecoin pegged to $1) on whichever blockchain it trades on. No other tokens are needed — Turbine is fully gasless.

> **For users new to prediction markets / crypto:** The concepts of "chains," "USDC," and "funding a wallet" are foreign. Explain before asking them to choose:
> - "Your bot trades using **USDC**, which is a digital dollar — 1 USDC = $1 USD. It's the only currency you need."
> - "Turbine runs on different **blockchains** (think of them as different networks). You pick which one your bot trades on."
> - "The testnet option uses **fake money** — completely free, no risk. This is the right choice for learning. You can switch to real money later if you want to compete in the weekly contest."
>
> **For non-PM users, strongly recommend Base Sepolia** and frame it as the obvious default. Don't present it as an equal choice with Polygon — a beginner shouldn't be spending real money until they understand what their bot is doing.

### Explain the chain options:

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- **"Which chain do you want to trade on?"**
- Options:
  - "Base Sepolia — testnet, no real money (Recommended for learning)"
  - "Polygon — real USDC, real trading, weekly competitions"

### If Base Sepolia (testnet):

> "Base Sepolia uses test USDC — no real money at risk. Great for learning how everything works before trading with real funds."

Testnet USDC acquisition varies — the user may need to get test tokens from a faucet or from someone on the Turbine team. Guide them to check Turbine's Discord or docs for the current faucet flow.

Update `.env` to set `CHAIN_ID=84532` (should already be the default).

### If Polygon (mainnet):

> "Polygon uses real USDC. You'll need at least ~$10 of USDC on the Polygon network. You can bridge USDC from other chains or withdraw from an exchange (Coinbase, Binance, etc.) that supports Polygon withdrawals."

> **For non-PM users who chose Polygon:** This will be hard. They likely don't have USDC, don't know how to bridge, and may not have an exchange account. Be explicit about the steps: "You'll need to buy USDC on an exchange like Coinbase, then withdraw it to your wallet address on the Polygon network. If this sounds complicated, I'd recommend starting on Base Sepolia (testnet) first — it's free and you can switch to real trading anytime."

**USDC contract on Polygon:** `0x3c499c542cEF5E3811e1192ce70d8cC03d5c3359`

Update `.env` to set `CHAIN_ID=137`:

```
CHAIN_ID=137
```

Remind them: **No MATIC or other gas tokens needed.** Turbine's relayer pays all gas fees. They only need USDC.

---

## Step 5: Verify Everything

Run a final check to make sure the full setup works:

```bash
# Activate venv if needed
source .venv/bin/activate 2>/dev/null

# Verify SDK imports
python3 -c "
from turbine_client import TurbineClient
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

pk = os.environ.get('TURBINE_PRIVATE_KEY', '')
chain = os.environ.get('CHAIN_ID', '84532')
host = os.environ.get('TURBINE_HOST', 'https://api.turbinefi.com')

if not pk or pk == '0x':
    print('FAIL: No private key in .env')
else:
    client = TurbineClient(host=host, chain_id=int(chain), private_key=pk)
    print(f'Wallet address: {client.address}')
    print(f'Chain: {chain}')
    print(f'Host: {host}')

    # Try fetching current market to verify API connectivity
    try:
        qm = client.get_quick_market('BTC')
        strike = qm.start_price / 1e6
        print(f'Current BTC market: strike \${strike:,.2f}')
        print('API connection: OK')
    except Exception as e:
        print(f'API connection: FAILED ({e})')

print()
print('Setup verification complete.')
"
```

Report results to the user clearly:
- Wallet address (so they know where to send USDC)
- Chain they're configured for
- Whether the API is reachable
- Whether there's an active BTC market (confirms everything works end-to-end)

> **For non-technical users:** Don't just dump the output. Interpret it for them in plain language:
> - "Your wallet address is `0x...` — this is like your account number on Turbine."
> - "You're connected to Base Sepolia (the testnet), so no real money is involved."
> - "I can see there's an active BTC market right now with a strike price of $X — that means your bot will be betting on whether Bitcoin goes above or below that price."
> - "Everything is working. You're ready to create your first bot."

> **For users new to PMs:** This is a good moment to connect the dots. They've been doing technical setup and may have lost the thread of *what* they're building. Briefly remind them: "Your setup is connected to a live prediction market right now — it's asking whether BTC will be above $X in the next 15 minutes. When we build your bot next, it'll trade on markets exactly like this one."

**Update `user-context.md`** with the wallet address and chain from the verification output. This keeps the user context file current for other skills.

---

## Step 6: Handoff

Everything is set up. Tell the user what they've accomplished and what's next:

> **You're all set up!** Here's what's ready:
> - Python environment with Turbine SDK installed
> - Wallet configured (address: `0x...`)
> - Trading on [chain name]
> - API connection verified
>
> **Next step: Create your first trading bot.**
>
> Run `/create-bot` — it'll help you pick a trading algorithm and generate a complete bot file. The recommended starting point is the **Price Action** strategy, which trades based on real-time BTC price movement.
>
> Or if you want to explore first:
> - Read `examples/price_action_bot.py` to see how a complete bot works
> - Check `docs/prediction-markets.md` to understand how Turbine's markets work
> - Browse `examples/README.md` for a guide to all example files

**For users new to PMs:** Before handing off to `/create-bot`, make sure they have enough context to make a meaningful choice about strategy. If they said "Never heard of them" in profiling, add:

> "Before we build your bot, it's worth understanding what you're trading. Here's the short version: every 15 minutes, there's a new question — 'Will Bitcoin be above $X?' You can buy YES or NO shares. If you're right, each share pays $1. If you're wrong, you lose what you paid. Your bot automates this decision. If you want a deeper explanation, check out `docs/prediction-markets.md` — or I can walk you through it right now."

This bridges the gap between setup (technical) and create-bot (requires understanding the domain).

### Where to go next — terminal vs IDE

**If the user is comfortable with an IDE** (technical users), suggest moving to their editor:

> "Your repo is all set up. If you use VSCode, Cursor, or another IDE, I'd recommend opening this folder there — you get syntax highlighting, a built-in terminal, and Claude Code works the same way."
>
> "To pick up where we left off, open your IDE's integrated terminal and run:"
> ```
> claude "/create-bot"
> ```
> "That'll start Claude Code and jump straight into bot creation."

**If the user prefers to stay in terminal** (or is non-technical), explain the two-terminal workflow they'll need when it's time to run the bot:

> "One thing to know: when you run your bot later, it takes over the terminal window — so you won't be able to talk to Claude and run the bot in the same window. The easy fix is to open a **second terminal window** when it's time to run the bot. One window stays for Claude, the other runs your bot."

Don't suggest this for non-technical users upfront — wait until they get to the "run it" step. Just keep them in the current terminal for now.

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- **"Want to create your first trading bot now?"**
- Options: "Yes, let's build a bot" / "No, I want to explore first"

If yes and staying in this terminal: Tell them to run `/create-bot`.
If yes and switching to IDE: Give them the command to copy: `claude "/create-bot"`
If no: Wish them well and remind them `/create-bot` is there when they're ready.
